### Authentication/Authorization Components Commented Out

The following components and features have been bypassed for UI testing:

9. **Settings** - `/settings`

### How to Implement These Changes

#### To activate the new authentication-free version:

1. **Replace App.tsx:**
   ```bash
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.old.tsx"
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.new.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.tsx"
   ```

2. **Replace AppLayout.tsx:**
   ```bash
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.old.tsx"
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.new.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.tsx"
   ```

#### To revert back to authenticated version:

1. **Restore original files:**
   ```bash
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.old.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.tsx"
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.old.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.tsx"
   ```

### Testing the New Setup

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to** `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Expected Flow:**
   - Landing on Home page with system introduction
   - Click "Get Started" or "Explore System" ‚Üí Navigate to Dashboard
   - Access all modules via dashboard cards or navigation menu
   - No authentication required for any page

### Accessibility Improvements Made

1. **Button Accessibility:**
   - Added `title` attributes to icon-only buttons
   - Added `aria-label` for screen readers
   - Fixed "Buttons must have discernible text" warnings

   - Restore `authService` integration
   - Re-implement user context

2. **Update Navigation:**
   - Restore role-based menu generation
   - Add login/logout functionality
   - Implement user profile integration

3. **Security:**
