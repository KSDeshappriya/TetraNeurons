### Authentication/Authorization Components Commented Out

The following components and features have been bypassed for UI testing:

#### Authentication Services
- `authService.getTokenPayload()` calls
- `authService.logout()` functionality
- User role detection and restrictions

#### Protected Routes
- `AuthRoute`, `UserRoute`, `VolunteerRoute`, `FirstResponderRoute`, `GovernmentRoute`
- `PrivateRoute` components
- All role-based access controls

#### User Management
- Login/logout functionality
- User profile data from authentication
- Role-based menu generation

### Navigation Structure

#### New Universal Navigation Menu:
1. **Dashboard** - `/dashboard` (Main system overview)
2. **Emergency Reports** - `/user/reports`
3. **Volunteers** - `/volunteer`
4. **First Responders** - `/first_responder`
5. **Government** - `/government`
6. **Resources** - `/user/resources`
7. **Communication** - `/communication`
8. **Profile** - `/profile`
9. **Settings** - `/settings`

### How to Implement These Changes

#### To activate the new authentication-free version:

1. **Replace App.tsx:**
   ```bash
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.old.tsx"
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.new.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.tsx"
   ```

2. **Replace AppLayout.tsx:**
   ```bash
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.old.tsx"
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.new.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.tsx"
   ```

#### To revert back to authenticated version:

1. **Restore original files:**
   ```bash
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.old.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\App.tsx"
   mv "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.old.tsx" "d:\Git Folder\TetraNeurons\frontend\src\components\layout\AppLayout.tsx"
   ```

### Testing the New Setup

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to** `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Expected Flow:**
   - Landing on Home page with system introduction
   - Click "Get Started" or "Explore System" ‚Üí Navigate to Dashboard
   - Access all modules via dashboard cards or navigation menu
   - No authentication required for any page

### Accessibility Improvements Made

1. **Button Accessibility:**
   - Added `title` attributes to icon-only buttons
   - Added `aria-label` for screen readers
   - Fixed "Buttons must have discernible text" warnings

2. **Navigation Accessibility:**
   - Clear navigation labels
   - Proper semantic HTML structure
   - Focus management for mobile menu

### Future Considerations

When re-implementing authentication:

1. **Restore Protected Routes:**
   - Uncomment role-based route guards
   - Restore `authService` integration
   - Re-implement user context

2. **Update Navigation:**
   - Restore role-based menu generation
   - Add login/logout functionality
   - Implement user profile integration

3. **Security:**
   - Re-enable authentication middleware
   - Restore API authorization headers
   - Implement session management
